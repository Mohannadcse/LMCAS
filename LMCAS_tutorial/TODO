Notes:
	The python script works really well on my ubuntu, but does not seem to want to work on docker
	Seems like the reason for this is one of the functions I am using is quite recent and the ver-	      sion of matplotlib on docker does not like that.

	Will take a look at the issue later, hoping you can help out with configuring the docker 
	correctly
